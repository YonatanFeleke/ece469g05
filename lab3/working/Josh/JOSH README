To josh: 
	Line1295-commented out the indirect translation table maker in DfsInodeWriteBytes
		- handled in AllocateVirtual that gets called when phyNum = UNALLOC
			changed- translate virtual to returns unalloc when missing table
	Added flush functionality 
	Fixed other bugs so use my copy and merge
	changed debug prototypes and a new function so need to get new dfs.h
	
Take a look at test 3 of urs, thats what is running right now but i've gone tru 1 and 2 and they 
work as they should.
