dlxos will only have one process at a time.
So process1 $20 -> memory location $FFFC
   process2 $20 -> memory location $FFFA

6 pages to one process 2,2,1,1 code data heap and stack

in Memory.c search for the lastosadrress -> calculate last memory adress
    -> allows to initialize the freemap.

1) allocPage -> called whenever you get a new page. runs freemap-freepage-sets it to one - get page entry
        - writes it into memory.c. return the 
2) page fault handler ->
if you allocate a page at 0x28 and it has a total of say 4k then we check if it has passed it.
